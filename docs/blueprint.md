## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent creativity and innovation, reflecting the spirit of the design competition. The user is in a position of 'looking outward' toward creative submissions, and should be engaged by this outward-pointing blue.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F6FD), a very light tint of the primary blue, to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A bright lime green (#BFFF00) for interactive elements and calls to action. This provides a strong contrast and visual interest.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern and fashionable aesthetic suitable for headings and titles.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to ensure readability for contest details and descriptions; pair with 'Poppins' if longer text is anticipated.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different sections and actions, maintaining a consistent and modern look.
- Implement a grid-based layout for the artwork gallery to showcase entries in a visually appealing manner.
